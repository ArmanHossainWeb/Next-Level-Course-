#1-1 Intro to module, what do we mean when we say critical thinking?

What is critical thinking?
Critical thinking in programming means analyzing problems logically, questioning assumptions, and testing ideas step-by-step to write efficient, bug-free code. Programmers use it to break down complex tasks, evaluate algorithms, debug errors, and choose the best solutions instead of copying code blindly.

Components of Critical Thinking
1) Knowing the Tools and Ideas
Master programming languages, libraries, and patterns to select efficient solutions quickly. Evaluate trade-offs like speed versus simplicity for better code choices.​

2) Decomposing Requirements
Break complex tasks into small, clear steps; spot edge cases and test assumptions. This prevents bugs and simplifies debugging.​

3) Seeing the Big Picture
View how code components interact for scalability, security, and maintenance. Balance local fixes with overall system performance.​
